WHITE PIECE:
    MOVEMENT:
    if row % 2 == 0:
    moving left is row + 1 and col - 1, if col is 0, invalid move.
    moving right is row + 1 and col, if col is 3, invalid move.

    if row % 2 == 1:
    moving left is row + 1 and col
    moving right is row+1 and col + 1, if col is 3, invalid move.

    EATING:
    if row % 2 == 0:
    eating left is:
        check for row+1 and col-1 if there is a piece. if there is let x be row+1 and y be col -1:
            check if x+1 and y is empty. Then if empty, transfer piece there. 
            This part is because row now is odd, so apply the left principle for odd rows.
    eating right is:
        check for row+1 and col if there is a piece. if there is let x be row+1 and y be col:
            check if x+1 and y+1 is empty. Then if empty, transfer piece there.
